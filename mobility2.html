				2 - My internship experience 
				</h9>
				
				<br><br><br><br>
				<h7>Working on the project they gave me turned out to be very pleasant even if the main themes were completly new to me. <br>
				I had to work with small devices called boards that look like this: <br>
				
				<div id="fox"> <img src="img/esp.png" style="width: 225px;" /> </div>
				<descriptionb>An ESP32 board</descriptionb>
				<br><br><br><br>It is commonly used in electronic engineering to do on-board computing, which is the field of computer science that specialize in small programs running on small devices but are very efficient. <br>
				I had to connect different sensors to these boards in order to measure the temperature, the humidity and the air quality in the room. I then had to send the data to a website where a machine learning algorithm was localized. This algorithm's job was to tell us if the room was either comfortable or not. For example, if the temperature was a bit too low, or too high, the algorithm would have told us the room was not comfortable.

				<description3>The different metrics recorded and the result of the algorithm</description3>
				<br><br><br><br>I even did a little bit of 3D printing to fix the sensors on the different walls of the room.
