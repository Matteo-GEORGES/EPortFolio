				In April 2022, I had the opportunity to spend two and a half months in Tallaght, Ireland in order to do my DUT internship. It was an amazing experience full of emotions. <br><br>
				Here is a summary.

				1 - Why did I go in Ireland?
				</h9>
				
				<br><br><br><br>
				<h7>In order to obtain the DUT diploma, it is mandatory to do a two and a half month internship in a company. I At the time when I was looking for a place that hires interns, my English teacher told me about an engineering school in Dublin that could welcome me during this period of time. <br>
				I did not hesitate for a second and accepted the offer immediately. <br><br>
				I really wanted to go to Ireland for multiple reasons: <br><br>
				
				• Being in an entirely English environment to improve both in writing, but mainly in spoken English. <br>
				Fun story: The first time I met with my supervisor, he talked for over an hour and a half about my internship, my future project, the school... and I could only understand ~40% of what he was saying. His Irish accent was pretty strong, but it was mostly because I was not as good as I am today, and I have improved a lot since that thank to this internship. <br> <br>
				
				• Work on a project I was not familiar with <br>
				I did my DUT in computer science and this internship was more about electronic engineering. And even if I was a bit scared in the beginning about the fact that I knew almost nothing about it, it ended up being a very interesting project where I worked on on-board computing but also 3D-printing and even Machine Learning AI. <br><br>
				• The country seemed very nice<br>
				And I was right! <br>
				I visited Dublin during the weekends and I went to the Zoo which was awesome.

				But I also went to the west coast to look at the cliffs of Moher and once again, it did not disappoint me.

				<description2>It does not look like so, but the cliffs are actually more than 200 meters high</description>
